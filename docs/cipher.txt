TopSecret - Cipher
Ananya Dandemraju
2/8/26

The entry point for the program will be TopSecret, but the cipher implementation
will be housed in decipher.java

This component takes in 1 required input, the ciphered text as a string,
and 1 (optional) argument, the path to a key file used for deciphering.

This feature should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.
The cipher will be stored in a file named key.txt, stored in a folder, ciphers,
(in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
This file will contain two lines, the first line is the actual letter,
the second line is the cipher match. When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated.

Psuedocode:
    keyMap : HashMap<Character, Character>
    keyPath : Path

    //constructor
    set this.keyPath = keyPath
    initialize keyMap as new HashMap

    read all lines from keyPath into lines
    if lines != 2
        throw error

    actual = lines[0]
    cipher = lines[1]

    if length of actual != length of cipher
        throw error

    if hasDuplicates(cipher)
        throw error

    if hasDuplicates(actual)
        throw error

    if actual.length()==0 || cipher.length()==0
        throw error

    validateKey(actual, cipher)

    let keyMap = map<cipherChar, actualChar>

    for i from 0 to length of cipher
        keyMap.put(cipher.charAt(i), actual.charAt(i))

    let result = new StringBuilder()

    for each letter in text
        letter = text.charAt(i)

        if keyMap contains letter
            result.append(keyMap.get(letter))
        else
            result.append(letter)

    return result.toString()

Tests:
    loadKey()
        1. works with a correct key.txt
        2. doesn't work with a fake path with no file
        3. more than 2 lines
        4. actual and cipher don't have same length

    decode()
        1. empty map

    hasDuplicates
        1. cipher has duplicates
        2. actual has duplicates
        3. no duplicates
        4. both have duplicates
