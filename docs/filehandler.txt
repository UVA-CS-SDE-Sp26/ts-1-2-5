TopSecret - Data Handling
Avery Li
2/4/26

The entry point for program will be TopSecret, but the implementation will be housed in DataHandling.java

This program takes in 1 (optional) argument, the name of the file to be requested, as a string.

You are responsible for the part of the problem that reads data files. The program should expect files in a
folder named data (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.) When a request
for a file is received, this part of the program will return the file contents. This part of the program should
handle all the direct access to files. Document the plan your team makes for the design of your software in a
text file named filehandler.txt.

As such, the two tasks assigned will be divided into two functions, one for returning text of a file and the other for
returning the names of all the files

Pseudocode for returning names of files:
//takes in no arguments, returns array of type String[]
import java.io.File

let path = "./data/"
let folder = new File(path)
let names = folder.list()
return names

Pseudocode for returning text of a file:
//takes in one string argument, name of file, called name, returns String output, contents of file
//throws FileNotFoundException
import java.util.Scanner
import java.io.File
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

let file = new File(name)
let res = ""
let fileReader = new Scanner(file)
while (fileReader.hasNextLine()):
    res += fileReader.nextLine() + "\n";
return res
