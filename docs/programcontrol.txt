TopSecret - Program Control (Role C)
Niya Talluri

Purpose: To connect the command line to the file handler. It takes what the user inputs
through the command line, deciphers it, and then it returns the contents of the deciphered file.

The program should be able to:
1: Provide a list of the files available, numbered
2: Request for a specific file, and return the deciphered contents of that file
3: Request for a specific file that's deciphered with an alternative key, and return the contents of that
file deciphered with the alternate key

For this program, there will be one private instance variable, fileHandler, which has a references the FileHandler
reference object.

Pseudocode for listFiles method:
let files be equal to an array of the possible files by calling fileHandler.getNames()
let returnFiles be an empty string that will store a list of the files
for each index from 0 to the length of the files - 1:
    returnFiles += a numbered line with file name
return returnFiles

Pseudocode for getFileName method (this method takes in a string fileNumber):
let fileIndex equal to an integer version of the fileNumber - 1
let fileName equal to fileHandler.getNames()[fileIndex]
return fileName

Pseudocode for getDecipheredFile method (this method takes in a string fileNumber):
let keyPath equal to the path of key.txt
let cipher equal to new cipher(keyPath)
cipher.loadKey()
let fileName equal to getFileName(fileNumber)
let fileContents equal to fileHandler.readFile(fileName)
return cipher.decode(fileContents)

Pseudocode for getAlternateKeyDecipheredFile method (this method takes in a string fileNumber and a string decipheringKey)
let keyPath equal to the path of the decipheringKey
let cipher equal to new cipher(keyPath)
cipher.loadKey()
let fileName equal to getFileName(fileNumber)
let fileContents equal to fileHandler.readFile(fileName)
return cipher.decode(fileContents)


Tests:
listFiles():
    return a numbered list of the files available

getFileName(fileNumber):
    if fileNumber is "01", then the file's name, "carnivore.txt", will be returned
    if fileNumber is "04", then the file's name, "cointelpro.txt", will be returned

getDecipheredFile(fileNumber):
    if fileNumber is "03", then the deciphered contents of "carnivore.cip" using the deciphering key key.txt must be returned
    if fileNumber is "02", then the deciphered contents of "cointelpro.cip" using the deciphering key key.txt must be returned

getDecipheredFile(fileNumber, decipheringKey):
    if fileNumber is "04", then the deciphered contents of "cointelpro.txt" using the deciphering key alternateKey.txt must be returned
    if fileNumber is "01", then the deciphered contents of "carnivore.txt" using the deciphering key alternateKey.txt must be returned

Also, the alternate key in my tests simply is a reverse of the original key in key.txt. This explains why if my fileNumber was "01", for example,
meaning that it would refer to the contents of "carnivore.txt", then what would be returned would be the contents of "carnivore.cip",
which is the opposite of how it would work for the original key.
