TopSecret - Program Control (Role C)
Niya Talluri

Purpose: To connect the command line to the file handler. It takes what the user inputs
through the command line, deciphers it, and then it returns the contents of the deciphered file.

Possible Outcomes Based on What the User Types on the Command Line:
If the user inputs zero argument, the list of files from Team Member B's method returning the numbered files available is displayed
If the user inputs one argument, the contents of that file should be returned and deciphered by
the default key.
If the user inputs two arguments, the first parameter will specify what file and the second parameter
is an alternate key used to decipher the file.


Pseudocode for decipheredFileContents method
if args has no arguments:
    call and return Team Member B's method returning the numbered files available to display

let fileContents be equal to what is returned from Team Member B's method that returns the contents of the file using userInput's first argument
let decipheredFile equal an empty string

if args has one argument:
    for each line in fileContents:
        decipheredFile += Team Member D's method deciphering the line from fileContents

if args has two arguments:
    for each line in fileContents:
        decipheredFile += Team Member D's method deciphering the line from fileContents using userInput's second argument as the deciphering key
return decipheredFile


Tests:

decipheredFileContents():
    if args is an empty list, then a list of all the files numbered must be returned
    if args has one argument, then the deciphered contents of that file will be returned
    if args has two arguments, then the contents of that file will be returned using the deciphering key in the second argument
    if args has 3 or more arguments, then an empty string will be returned
